title: My Experience at Bloc
---

I have just finished up with my Frontend section of my Bloc course and I am about 30% to 40% done with the curriculumn overall. So far I have had two different mentors, Chris worked with me through the Foundations sections where I learned the basics of being a developer, and Ben took over to help me learn the frontend. 

I have learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and it was a lot easier for me to pick up than I thought it would be. Building on the fundamentals I moved on to learning Jquery, Angular, and a whole bunch of other tools to make web development easier. 

I am looking forward to getting into backend development and learning all about Ruby! Only about 4 more months to go!
